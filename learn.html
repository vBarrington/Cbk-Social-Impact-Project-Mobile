    <p>It may be tempting when you aren't sure whether something is recyclable, to just put it in the recycling bin anyways, in a hope (or even an assumption) that "they'll find a way to recycle it." This is called "wishcycling."  In order to keep our recycling system healthy, it's just as important to leave stuff out of the recycling as it is important to but the good recyclable stuff in the recycling.</p>
    <p>Whenever you try to recycle items that you shouldn't, it harms recycling. Sometimes those items can put recycling facility workers at risk or danger; sometimes those items cause the recycler to lose money if they tried to sort or process them (for a variety of reasons), so the recycler has to then pay to landfill the material anyway; and sometimes those items really slow down the recycling facility operations so that fewer overall materials can be processed by the facility each day, which hurts the health of the recycling business. The recycling system was built especially to sort and process these select materials, but not everything else. All the materials that end up as waste from our households that aren't recyclable are either not valuable enough to create a recycling stream for, or not recyclable at a big enough scale yet.

      <p id="content-img-para">Repurposing is always an option. Several items we try to get rid of can serve us purpose in other ways. Repurposing shows we can reuse resources and materials in a new way and be creative while using them over and over. <br> This article "<a id="link-button" href="https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/35-old-unused-items-that-can-be-recycled-at-home.php">40 Old Unused Items That Can Be Recycled at Home</a>" will give you ideas of where to start.</p>

    <p>What to do with items that cannot be recycled or trashed is the next question. The problem is finding how and where you can get rid of your stuff with the greatest advantage to you and the least amount of damage to the environment. There are a number of online and in-person services that can help you figure out how to responsibly get rid of things. A few online sites that will help you sell or give away items locally are Freecycle and NextDoor. These are great if you have items like a television, exercise equipments, etc.</p>
    <p>For an in-person service, check your township or city if there is a recycling center where you can drop off the items mentioned above, but also, batteries, light bulbs, paint, and more. An alternative to you dropping it off, which you will see on the<a href="resources.html">Resources</a>page, is Waste Management has a service where they will pick up those items for you. You can set up an appointment, leave those items outside, and they will take them off your hands. Though those items can build up in our homes, having a plan of how to dispose of them properly helps to protect others, improve efficiency in the recycling centers, have less in landfills and allows us to do our part in this cycle.</p>
